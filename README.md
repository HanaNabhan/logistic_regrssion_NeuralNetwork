# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
This project implements logistic regression using a neural network mindset as introduced in Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialization. Instead of relying on libraries like scikit-learn, this implementation is done from scratch using NumPy to strengthen  understanding of the underlying mechanics of machine learning.
